# Korjaus-Kahvila  🪡☕🛠
A repair café - a place to get together and fix things

A community repair café model for resistance to waste culture, skill erosion, and capitalist disposability.  

**Korjaus Kahvila** (Finnish for "Repair Café") is a mutual aid gathering where volunteers and community members meet to repair broken items, share skills, and slow down together. It’s part workshop, part gathering, part protest.  

This repository contains templates, resources, and guidance for hosting your own Korjaus Kahvila — and for adapting it to your local context.

## 🌼 A Note on Emergence  

Before diving into logistics and templates, we invite you to read [`STARTING TOGETHER`](./STARTING-TOGETHER.md) — a short reflection on how to begin. It’s not about branding or identity. It’s about feeling your way with your own community, using what helps and making it your own.

## 🌱 What’s in this repository?  

- [`RISK ASSESSMENT`](./docs/Risk-Assessment-en.md): A markdown-formatted health & safety risk assessment for use in venues, grant applications, or volunteer training. Fork it. Adapt it. Keep people safe.  
- `POSTER_TEMPLATE/`: (coming soon) Visual resources for sharing key safety messages, etiquette, and volunteer guidance in a friendly, non-hierarchical way.  
- `CHECKLIST.md`: (coming soon) A lightweight planning and setup checklist for first-time organisers.  
- `VALUES.md`: (optional) A declaration of the cultural and political values underpinning this format (e.g. repair as resistance, accessibility, care, anti-waste, decolonialism).

## 💡 What kind of things get repaired?  

It depends on the people and the skills in the room. Typical repair zones may include:  

- 🧵 Clothing and textiles (patching, darning, mending)  
- 🔌 Small electronics (toasters, radios, lamps, etc.)  
- 🚲 Bicycle fixes and adjustments  
- 🪑 Furniture glueing or hinge repair  
- 🧰 Tool sharpening  
- 📚 Bookbinding or paper fixes  

Each event can be different. Sometimes things don’t get fixed. That’s okay too.

## 🤝 How to start your own Korjaus Kahvila  

1. **Find a space** — community hall, library, school, squat, shed.  
2. **Gather volunteers** — repairers, welcomers, tea-makers.  
3. **Set a date and share** — social media, posters, word-of-mouth.  
4. **Use this repo** — copy the risk assessment, make your own signage.  
5. **Show up with care** — not every fix is material. Some are emotional.

## 🧷 Principles (suggested, not imposed)  

- No money changes hands  
- No one is responsible for fixing everything  
- We repair together — side by side, not top-down  
- Safety is collective, not bureaucratic  
- Slowness is a feature, not a bug  
- Failure is allowed
