# Starting Together

This repository contains tools, templates, and documents from one community's version of a Korjaus Kahvila (Repair Café).

You're welcome to copy anything here that helps you start your own.

But this isn't a brand, and it isn’t a template to follow exactly. It’s a starting point — a collection of things that emerged through relationships, conversations, and care. If you’re starting something similar, the most important thing is:

**Start with the people you know.**

Talk with your neighbours, your friends, your workshop buddies. Talk about what kind of repair space would feel good to *you*.

Let the feeling come first — then let your colours, signs, invitations, and rhythms grow out of that.

You can reuse the risk assessments, or the registration forms, or the signage templates. We’ve included versions that are easy to adapt. Use what’s useful. But don’t feel like you need to adopt the same fonts or colours or name. You’re encouraged to create your own look, your own tone, your own gestures of welcome.

We avoid the word "branding" here, because it suggests ownership and control — and it’s historically linked to colonisation and commodification. We also try not to rely too heavily on the word "visual", because we know community is felt in many ways — not just what it looks like, but how it *feels*, how it *moves*, how it *sounds*, how it *holds space*. 

So we’re not offering a visual identity. We’re offering an invitation to emergence.

If you make something with this, we’d love to hear about it. But more importantly, we hope you feel free to make it your own.

Start together. Feel your way. Repair gently.
