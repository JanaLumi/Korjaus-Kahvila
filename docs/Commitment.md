# ðŸ›  Repairer Commitments Poster (Draft)

A guide for repairers who help others fix things.  
This isnâ€™t a contract. Itâ€™s a shared understanding.  

As a repairer, I will do my best to:

- Welcome people kindly â€” not just their broken things  
- Listen before I touch or suggest a fix  
- Ask for consent before taking over a repair  
- **Never take tools or items out of somebodyâ€™s hands** â€”  
  unless there is immediate danger, and even then,  
  I will speak with care  
- Explain what Iâ€™m doing as I go, so others can learn  
- Be honest if I donâ€™t know how to fix something  
- Share tools, time, and attention fairly  
- Help keep the space safe â€” for people, objects, and feelings  
- Leave no one behind in a mess I helped make  

And I understand:

- No one is entitled to another personâ€™s space, body, or tools  
- Not every fix is possible â€” or necessary  
- It's okay to be tired or to step back  
- Iâ€™m not doing this alone â€” others are here too  
- If things feel off, I can pause or ask for support  
- Sometimes the best repair is just being present  

**This cafÃ© works because we hold it together.**  
Not perfectly. Not always.  
But enough.  

And if we can't hold it together today â€”  
then it's okay to rest.  
We can try again next time.
